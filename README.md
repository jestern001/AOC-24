# Jestern001's Advent of Code 2024 Solutions

## Background
My solutions for [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024)

## Restrictions
This year, I had less time so I decided to go with what I know.  I'll be using Jupyter notebooks to build my solutions.  If I get more time, I may swap to another language such as Rust or TypeScript later on.
